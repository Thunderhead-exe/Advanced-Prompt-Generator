# Advanced Prompt Generator

![Banner Image Placeholder](media/Banner.jpg)

## Overview
This project is an **LLM-based Advanced Prompt Generator** designed to automate the process of prompt engineering by enhancing given input prompts using large language models (LLMs). Following established prompt engineering principles, the tool can generate advanced prompts with a simple click, leveraging LLM agents for optimized prompt generation.

You can demo this solution on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Adam-Ben-Khalifa/Advanced_Prompt_Generator).

Also you can check this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@AdamBenKhalifa/an-ai-agent-to-replace-prompt-engineers-ed2864e23549) about this solution for more details!

## Key Features
- **Automated Prompt Engineering:** AI Agent based prompt engineering processes, requiring minimal user input.
- **Uses OpenAI APIs:** Support for gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini (we recommend gpt-4o-mini).
- **FastAPI & Docker Deployment:** Ensures efficient and scalable backend deployment.
- **Gradio Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for testing the prompt generation.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for quck demo.

## Next Steps
- **Expand Model Support:** Integrate additional models to offer more variety and flexibility.

- **Reasoning**: Breaking down the writing process into clear steps helps authors navigate their journey systematically and reduces overwhelm.
- **Success criteria**: Each step should be defined with actionable tips, such as techniques for brainstorming ideas, structuring an outline, and strategies for effective drafting and revising.

*Subtask 3*:
- **Description**: Provide tips for maintaining motivation and overcoming writer's block.
- **Reasoning**: Addressing common challenges like writer's block is crucial for sustaining progress and ensuring authors remain engaged with their writing.
- **Success criteria**: Include practical strategies, such as setting small goals, taking breaks, and using prompts to reignite creativity.

*Subtask 4*:
- **Description**: Advise on setting a writing schedule and establishing a conducive writing environment.
- **Reasoning**: A structured writing schedule and a supportive environment are essential for productivity and focus during the writing process.
- **Success criteria**: Offer specific recommendations for daily writing routines and tips for creating a distraction-free workspace.

## ***Example 2***
```
>>> Input Prompt:
write a python script to compute and plot the fibonacci spiral
```
```
>>> Enhanced Prompt:
As a programming expert, please create a Python script that computes and plots the Fibonacci spiral. 

Requirements:
- Use the Fibonacci sequence to generate the necessary points for the spiral.
- Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib for plotting and NumPy for numerical calculations.
- Include comments explaining each step of the code.
- Ensure the script is modular, allowing for easy adjustments to the number of Fibonacci terms used in the spiral.

Provide the implementation with:
- Function to compute Fibonacci numbers up to a specified term.
- Function to plot the Fibonacci spiral using the computed points.
- Example usage demonstrating the script in action, including a plot display.

The Fibonacci spiral should start with the first few Fibonacci numbers and visually represent the growth of the spiral based on these values.

##REFERENCE SUGGESTIONS##
- Matplotlib Documentation
  Purpose: Provides details on plotting functions and customization options
  Integration: Reference for creating and customizing plots in the script
- Fibonacci Sequence Article
  Purpose: Offers insights into the mathematical properties and applications of the Fibonacci sequence
  Integration: Use as a reference for understanding the sequence's generation and its relation to the spiral
- Python Programming Guide
  Purpose: Serves as a comprehensive resource for Python syntax and libraries
  Integration: Reference for general Python programming practices and functions used in the script

##THOUGHT PROCESS##

*Subtask 1*:
- **Description**: Create a function to compute Fibonacci numbers up to a specified term.
- **Reasoning**: This function is essential for generating the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which will be used to determine the points for the spiral.
- **Success criteria**: The function should return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the specified term, with correct values (e.g., for n=5, it should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]).

*Subtask 2*:
- **Description**: Implement a function to plot the Fibonacci spiral using the computed points.
- **Reasoning**: Plotting the spiral visually represents the growth of the Fibonacci sequence, making it easier to understand the relationship between the numbers and the spiral shape.
- **Success criteria**: The function should create a plot that accurately represents the Fibonacci spiral, with appropriate axes and labels, and should display the plot correctly.

*Subtask 3*:
- **Description**: Include comments explaining each step of the code.
- **Reasoning**: Comments enhance code readability and maintainability, allowing others (or the future self) to understand the logic and flow of the script.
- **Success criteria**: The code should have clear, concise comments that explain the purpose of each function and key steps within the functions.

*Subtask 4*:
- **Description**: Ensure the script is modular, allowing for easy adjustments to the number of Fibonacci terms used in the spiral.
- **Reasoning**: Modularity allows users to easily modify the number of terms without altering the core logic of the script, enhancing usability and flexibility.
- **Success criteria**: The script should allow the user to specify the number of Fibonacci terms as an input parameter, and the plot should update accordingly.

*Subtask 5*:
- **Description**: Provide example usage demonstrating the script in action, including a plot display.
- **Reasoning**: Example usage helps users understand how to implement and run the script, showcasing its functionality and output.
- **Success criteria**: The example should include a clear demonstration of how to call the functions, specify the number of terms, and display the resulting plot, with expected output shown.
